 EMC Model Explorer - an  EMC Notebook

 2022-09-09

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 DESCRIPTION:

 This is the Python 3 Jupyter Notebook to explore the content of an EMC Earth model file:
    - Accepts 2D and 3D EMC-compatible netCDF Earth model files in geographic coordinate system
    - Displays model metadata (in netCDF or GeoCSV formats)
    - Plots map of model's coverage area
    - Plots horizontal slices (maps), vertical slices (cross sections), and velocity profiles (line plots vs depth)
      from model data
    - Saves the generated plots and their corresponding data
    - Outputs the entire netCDF file or a selected portion of it in GeoCSV format (is created during the initial run)

REQUIREMENTS:
    - JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/)
    - Python 3
    - Python module(s) with the tested version:
             . numpy
             . xarray
             . netCDF4
             . scipy
             . cartopy
             . matplotlib
             . request

       - this package has been tested under Python 3.10.06 on macOS 12.5.1 (may work with older Python 3 versions)

 PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

       unpack the package
            . "notebook" directory contains the notebook and the utility file
            . "assets" directory under the notebook directory contains sample images displayed by the notebook
            . "data" directory is where the notebook looks for the netCDF model files to read
            . "data" directory of sample netCDF model files
            . "out" directory will contain output files generated by the notebook

 PACKAGE TEST:

    This package comes with the 'data' directory preloaded with one EMC netCDF file for testing. Just run the notebook
    as it is, using the "Restart and Run all" option (>>). It should load the sample model file from the data directory,
    and display information and plots for the model. You may copy other model files from the 'samples' directory and
    assign the desired file name to the 'model_file_name' variable under the "Load the Model" cell. Running the
    "Load the Model" cell with the new model name may produce an error if the variable name is not valid for the model.
    In that case, it will suggest possible variables you could select and assign to the 'default_data_var' variable.
