 EMC Model Explorer - an  EMC Notebook

 2022-09-09

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 DESCRIPTION:

 This is the Python 3 Jupyter Notebook to explore the content of an EMC Earth model file:
    - Accepts 2D and 3D EMC-compatible netCDF Earth model files in geographic coordinate system
    - Displays model metadata (in netCDF or GeoCSV formats)
    - Plots map of model's coverage area
    - Plots horizontal slices (maps), vertical slices (cross sections), and velocity profiles (line plots vs depth) from model data
    - Saves the generated plots and their corresponding data
    - Outputs the entire netCDF file or a selected portion of it in GeoCSV format (will be created during the initial run)

REQUIREMENTS:
    - JupyterLabor Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/)
    - Python 3
    - Python module(s) with the tested version:
             . numpy
             . xarray
             . scipy
             . cartopy
             . request

       - this package has been tested under Python 3.10.06 on macOS 12.5.1 (may work with older Python 3 versions)

 PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

       unpack the package
            . "notebook" directory contains the notebook and the utility file.
            . "assets" directory under the notebook directory contains sample images displayed by the notebook.
            . "data" directory is where the notebook looks for the netCDF model files to read
            . "out" directory will contain output files generated by the notebook

 PACKAGE TEST:

    Run the notebook as it is. It should load a sample model file and display information and plot related to the model
