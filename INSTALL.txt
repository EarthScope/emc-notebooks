 EMC Model Explorer - an  EMC Notebook
 Release: r0.5

 2022-09-22

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 DESCRIPTION:

 This is the Python 3 Jupyter Notebook to explore the content of an EMC Earth model file:
    - Accepts 2D and 3D EMC-compatible netCDF Earth model files in geographic coordinate system
    - Displays model metadata (in netCDF or GeoCSV formats)
    - Plots map of the model's coverage area
    - Plots horizontal slices (maps), vertical slices (cross sections), and velocity profiles (line plots vs depth)
      from the model data
    - Saves the generated plots and their corresponding data
    - Outputs the entire netCDF file or a selected portion of it in GeoCSV format 

REQUIREMENTS:
    - JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/)
    - Python 3
    - Python module(s) needed:
        . xarray
        . netCDF4
        . numpy
        . scipy
        . cartopy
        . matplotlib
        . jupyterlab
        . nodejs
        . ipywidgets
        . ipyfilechooser
        . request

   - this package has been tested under Python 3.10.06 on macOS 12.5.1 (may work with older Python 3 versions)

 PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

       unpack the package
            . "notebook" directory contains the notebook and the utility file
            . "assets" directory under the notebook directory contains sample images displayed by the notebook
            . "data" directory where the notebook looks for the netCDF model files to read
            . "samples" directory of sample netCDF model files
            . "out" directory to store the files generated by the notebook

 PACKAGE TEST:

    This package comes with a 'samples' directory preloaded with a few EMC netCDF file for testing. Just run the
    notebook as it is, using the "Restart and Run all" option (>>). It should load a sample model file from the samples
    directory, and display information and plots for the model. You load other model files using the file selection
    widget under the "Select a Model" section.
