 2022-09-09

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 DESCRIPTION:

This Jupyter Notebook reads an [EMC-compatible Earth model file](http://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/emc-earthmodels/) in the geographic coordinate system, and allows the user to explore its contents by: 

* Displaying the model metadata in either [netCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) or [GeoCSV](http://geows.ds.iris.edu/documents/GeoCSV.pdf) formats
* Creating horizontal slices (maps), vertical slices (cross-sections), and velocity profiles (line plots vs depth) from model data
* Saving the generated plots and their corresponding data to a local directory
* Outputing the entire netCDF file, or a selected portion of it in GeoCSV format
