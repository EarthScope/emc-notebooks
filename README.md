This Jupyter Notebook reads an [EMC-compatible Earth model file](http://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/emc-earthmodels/) in the geographic coordinate system, and allows the user to explore its contents by: 

* Displaying the model metadata in either [netCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) or [GeoCSV](http://geows.ds.iris.edu/documents/GeoCSV.pdf) formats
* Creating horizontal slices (maps), vertical slices (cross-sections), and velocity profiles (line plots vs depth) from the model data
* Saving the generated plots and their corresponding data to a local directory
* Outputting the entire netCDF file, or a selected portion of it in GeoCSV format

## Installation

Either clone the repository or download a [release](https://github.com/iris-edu/emc-notebooks/releases) and unzip/untar it.

### Requirements

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3
* Python modules listed in `requirements.txt`
  * Install these modules with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

This package has been tested under Python 3.10.06 on macOS 12.5.1, it may work with older Python 3 versions.

### Running the package

Notebooks can be executed a variety of ways, commonly either with JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/).

Using the `jupyterlab` module install from `requirements.txt` you can simply execute the following in a terminal:

```console
jupyter-lab
```

and open the `notebooks/emc_model_explorer.ipynb` notebook. For more information visit the [Wiki page](https://github.com/iris-edu/emc-notebooks/wiki)

### Package testing

This package comes with a `samples` directory pre-loaded with a few EMC netCDF files for testing. 
Run the notebook as it is, using the "Restart and Run all" option (>>).
It should load a sample model file from the samples directory, and display information and plots for the model.

You load other model files using the **file selection widget** under the **Select a Model** section.
